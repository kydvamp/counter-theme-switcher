# Counter Application

A lightweight, browser-based counter tool developed to strengthen core JavaScript skills, specifically focusing on DOM manipulation, state management, and event-driven behavior.

---

## Overview

This project serves as a practical exercise in implementing interactive UI components without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The application allows users to adjust a numerical value, reset the state, and toggle between light and dark themes.

---

## Features

- **Increment / Decrement Controls**  
  Modify the counter value with basic input validation.
  
- **Zero-State Guard**  
  The decrement button automatically hides when the value reaches zero, preventing invalid actions.

- **State Reset**  
  A dedicated reset control returns the counter to its initial state.

- **Dark Mode Support**  
  Theme switching implemented through class-based styling.

- **Responsive Layout**  
  Clean and consistent visual design across various screen sizes.

## Key Learnings

- DOM element selection and manipulation  
- Conditional rendering and logic flow  
- Event listener management  
- Implementation of theme toggling  
- UI behavior tied to application state  
- Structuring small JavaScript projects cleanly

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of a self-directed initiative to build a solid foundation in JavaScript through hands-on, project-based learning.
